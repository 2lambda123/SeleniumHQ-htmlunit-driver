Release
=======

If this is the first time you're doing a release you'll need to perform some setup.
Configure your SourceForge username in ~/.m2/settings.xml (see Security and Deployment Settings). As an example, my settings.xml looks like:

    <settings>
      ...
      <servers>
        <server>
          <id>htmlunit-website</id>
          <username>mguillem,htmlunit</username>
          <!-- optional element:
            <password>your-sourceforge-pwd</password>
          -->
        </server>
        <server>
          <id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>
          <username>your-jira-id</username>
          <!-- optional element:
            <password>your-jira-pwd</password>
          -->
        </server>
        <server>
          <id>ossrh</id>
          <username>your-jira-id</username>
          <!-- optional element:
            <password>your-jira-pwd</password>
          -->
        </server>
      </servers>
      ...
    </settings>

For Snapshots:

    mvn clean deploy

For Releases:

    Update the version number in pom.xml
    Commit your change

    Deploy the release to Sonatype OSS Maven repository.
        mvn clean deploy

    go to Sonatype OSS staging repository (https://oss.sonatype.org/index.html#stagingRepositories); close and release the artifacts.

    create a new release on github (https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/htmlunit-driver/releases)
    add the release notes

    build the file htmlunit-driver-2.xx.x-jar-with-dependencies.jar
        mvn assembly:single
    upload the file to the github release
    close the release on github

    inform about the new release
